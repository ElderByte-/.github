## Hello

ElderByte is a Swiss software company that is specialised in highly distributed software systems and cloud ☁️ ⚙️
We provide consulting, development and solution engineering for software projects

We have identified that long-term dependencies on tech stacks and vendors often prevent companies from having an innovative IT infrastructure. By using cloud-ready architectures such as microservices and open technology standards, we effectively avoid lock-ins. This enables our customers to pursue a highly agile software strategy and gain a competitive advantage. 🏆🙌
